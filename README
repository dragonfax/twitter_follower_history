A quick script to track my followers on twitter on a daily basis. 

uses a git repo to store the follower history for versioning.

uses the python based twitter api (version 1.10 at least) https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter

1. $ easy_install pip
2. $ pip twitter
3. $ twitter-follow -o <twitter-handle>
	 This sets up your oauth token. 
	 It will pass you to lynx to finish the oauth app authorization process.
4. create a repo in the same parent directory as this one, to hold the followers.txt
5. $ cron_wrapper

I put the cron_wrapper in cron to run once a day, to keep the file updated and checked into github.
