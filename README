A quick script to track my followers on twitter on a daily basis. 
This is probably too rudimentary to be useful to anyone but myself.

uses a git repo under the source directory to store the follower history.

1. register as a developer with twitter
2. get api credentials
3. install twitter api for python
	possibly from dev source, as it needs the cursor support for GetFollowers
4. create the follow_history sub-repo to store the follower list.
5. add cron_wrapper to crontab at desired interval
